	In the 2015 NYC Tech Meetup, one of the required videos to watch was one on Lynx. 
It introduces an app that gives a new way to share and discover links. With the app, links can be shared 
to other users with the app for it to appear in the app's own inbox, or it can be sent to others without the
link, it will just end up in the inbox. The app also displays trending links being shared. If the user
find the link worthy of being shared, it can be shared through the app.
	The second section of the meetup that was required to watch was the program TLDR, made
by Stuyvesant alumni. These alumni created a website that summarizes articles using an algorithim
that counts repeated words. Key terms will be displayed in a summary, making this program an
efficient way to filter through long articles.
	The third section was about a program called Vynl, which was also made by Stuyvesant
alumni. It gives a way for users to easily get music and put it in a playlist. This can then be shared via
the QR code. This simplifies the process of having to search the web for music, download the the music
file, and playing it in an order that is not easily modified. The playlists can be edited by anyone, and can
be upvoted or downvoted.
	The final section was about a program called Wibbitz. It automates something that woud have
taken many students at least a couple hours to do. It takes text from an article, licensed images, adds
fancy transitions, and text to speech to create a short video that summarizes the text in the aricle. This
website was created to display the information contained in long articles in a short amount of time in
a short, concise, and somewhat visually stimulating way.
