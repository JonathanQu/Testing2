Idea 1:  Tower Defence Game
Enemies travel down a set path while the player places towers that automatically deal damage to enemies as they pass in a certain way. As time progresses, enemies
become harder to kill and drop more money when they die. The money can be invested in buying more expensive towers.







Idea 2: Bullet Hell Spaceship Game
Using the usual WASD movement, a spaceship / turtle will be controlled and be able to fire its guns and missiles. As the game progresses,
there will be more enemies with more difficult movement and shooting patterns. The player can randomly pick up upgrades that improve the ship's
weapons.











Idea 3: Powder Game Recreation
Recreate a version of the classic physics simulation powder game that is suitable for use in netlogo. The powder game involves dropping squares that simiulate 
certain things in real life, such as water, fire, and explosive gas.
