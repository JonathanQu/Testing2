; HW18 -- Like a Dream Within a Dream... /Recursive Functions/ Using the concept of recursive functions, write a program that calculates factorial
; 2015-10-21

;fact is the mathematical function factorial
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
  (cond
    ((or (= n 0) (= n 1)) 1) ;accounts for the case of 1 and 0 factorial being one. Once a value of 1 is returned, this recusive will end and a product will be evaluated
    (else (* n (fact (- n 1))))))) ;multiplies n by n-1 followed by n-2 and so on and so forth
;by asking the fact function to evaluate the new n (which is n-1) as a factor of the first time fact was called.

(fact 0);1
(fact 1);1
(fact 2);2
(fact 3);6
(fact 4);24
(fact 5);120
(fact 6);720
