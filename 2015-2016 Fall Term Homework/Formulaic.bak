;Define CartDist that takes two coordinates and applies the distance
;formula to the two numbers.
(define CartDist
    (lambda (X1 Y1 X2 Y2)
        (sqrt (+ (* (- X2 X1) (- X2 X1)) (* (- Y2 Y1) (- Y2 Y1))))))
        
(CartDist 0 0 0 0) ;expected result is 0
(CartDist 4 4 4 4) ;expected result is 0
(CartDist 0 0 3 4) ;expected result is 5

;Define ArithMean3 as a function that takes three inputs and finds
;the average between them
(define ArithMean3 
    (lambda (a b c)
        (/ (+ a b c) 3)))

(ArithMean3 0 0 0) ;expected output is 0
(ArithMean3 1 2 3) ;expected output is 2
(ArithMean3 5 -10 20) ;expected outputs is 5

;Define Harmean3 as a function that takes the reciprocal of each
;input, averages them, then outputs the reciprocal of the average
;which is the harmoic mean
(define HarMean3
    (lambda ( a b c)
        (/ 1 (ArithMean3 (/ 1 a) (/ 1 b) (/ 1 c)))))
(HarMean3 5 5 5) ;expected output is 5
(HarMean3 3 6 18) ;expected output is 5.4
(HarMean3 5 -10 20) ;expected output is 20

;Define MAX2 as a function that takes two inputs and outputs the
;greater of the two inputs.
(define MAX2
  (lambda (a b)
    (* 0.5 (+ a b (abs (- a b))))))
;Taking the absolute value of the difference of a and b, then adding
;it to a and b will result in twice the larger number, dividing this
;in half results in the larger number

(MAX2 4 4) ;expected output is 4

(MAX2 9 8) ;expected output is 9
