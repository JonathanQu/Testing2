//This form of defining a simple variation of the hello world function
//is different in comparison to defining a function in
//python, netlogo, or scheme. The first line defines something called a class
//that is, perhaps, public. The second line contains the word public, but
//also something about the function being static. It also contains
//the word void, which might reference how the function takes no input.
//The second line also mentions something about strings and arguments.
//The third line seems to tell the computer(the system) to output
//a line with "No hablo queso." Overall, every opening bracked has a closing
//braket. The third line, which is the only line that contains an "action"
//has a semicolon at the end of it.
